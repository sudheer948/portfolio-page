A personal developer portfolio built using HTML5 and CSS3.  
It highlights my bio, skills, featured projects, and contact information — all in a clean, responsive layout.

 🔍 Description

This project is part of my 10-month roadmap to become a high-package full-stack developer.  
It showcases:
- Who I am (About section)
- My core tech skills
- A list of my recent projects (Tribute Page, Landing Page, and Portfolio itself)
- A contact link to connect with me via email

It is designed using semantic HTML and responsive styling techniques like Flexbox.
